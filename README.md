## About

Moe Memos is a third-party client for [✍️memos](https://github.com/usememos/memos) and both projects aren't affiliated with each other. Both projects are inspired by the memo-taking tool [flomo](https://flomoapp.com/). If you prefer an all-in-one alternative syncing with the cloud, it is recommended to try [flomo](https://flomoapp.com/).

## Development

Moe Memos tends to keep minimal and optimized for best native experience. It uses modern Swift and Apple platform features such as SwiftUI, async await and it keeps dependencies as few as possible.

Any contributions are greatly appreciated.
